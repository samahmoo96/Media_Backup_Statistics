# Media_Backup_Statistics
Ongoing project to take statistics on my personal media backup collection.

Using tools such as Tautulli I am able to track statistics of my personal media collection, to which I will be implementing a few variations of quantitative analysis techniques to discover new trends and patterns.

File library.csv contains my general collection of movies, while library_family.csv contains my general collection of family/kids movies (in source folder)
